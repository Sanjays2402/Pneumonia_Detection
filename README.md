# Pneumonia_Detection

Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It is caused by a bacteria called Streptococcus pneumonia that usually lives in the upper respiratory tract. More than 10 million people in India are affected by this annually. Doctors use a chest X-ray to confirm the infection and its location. Thus developing an automatic system for detecting the disease can help to treat the patients quickly. With the powerful Artificial Intelligence algorithms, the medical field has evolved in a very vast manner.

Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the go-to algorithm when it comes to image classification. CNN models are so powerful that they are already in use for many disease detections. Moreover, CNN models can be used to analyze and find patterns in the images. We build a CNN model to analyze the given X-ray image patterns and predict whether the patient is infected or not.
